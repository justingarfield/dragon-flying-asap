# DragonFlyingASAP

This repository contains a World of Warcraft: Dragonflight addon that helps players get their Dragon Flying and Full Upgrades nice and quickly.

This is a very rudimentary addon, and has not been tested with other addons running, other than TomTom. If it throws errors, I highly recommend having only it and TomTom enabled. You will only use this addon for a very limited time, and can disable it completely once your character has fully upgraded dragon flying.

## Features

* Monitors, tracks, and waypoints for all quests related to acquiring dragon flying, starting with "The Dragon Isles Await"
* Monitors, tracks, and waypoints for all dragon glyphs for dragon flying upgrades
* Integrates with TomTom for waypoints; but also falls-back to built-in waypoint system
* Automatically skips cinematics _(default, can be changed)_
* Automatically accepts / turns-in quests _(default, can be changed)_
* Automatically dismisses quest narrative dialogs that pop-up in middle of screen sometimes _(default, can be changed)_
